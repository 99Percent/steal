# Good artists copy; great artists steal.

StealJS is a client module loader and builder that will
help you create the next great app. Its designed to simplify 
dependency management while being extremely powerful and flexible.

Its client loader, [steal] supports the future - 
[ES6 Module Loader](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader) syntax -
with everything [traceur supports](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures),
while supporting AMD, and CommonJS.

It also makes common use cases as simply as possible. Steal automatically
loads a config file, supports css and less, and can load plugins by 
extension (no more writing `!less` in `styles.less!less`).

Its builder, [steal-tools] lets you build an application or export
your project to AMD, CommonJS or standalone formats. But steal-tools 
killer feature, it can build progressively loaded apps that 
balance caching and the number of script requests.
